<p>We first <a href="https://svalbard.biologie.hu-berlin.de:443/d/c291b870178f4abc8c59/">download the data</a> set from consisting of 192 fastq file-pairs from 18S and 16S amplicon sequencing of feces and intestinal contents of carnivores (hyenas and wolves). Use the botton on the upper right of the page to download a zipped folder and unzip it after downloading. The help file for the <a href="https://derele.github.io/MultiAmplicon/reference/carnivoreSeqRuns.html"><code>carnivoreSeqRuns</code></a> (containing sample data included in the package), shows how this data has been downloaded from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA386767">NCBI-SRA</a>.</p>
<p>Now we can run our standard workflow. But as usual with real data we have to filter the input files first. This particular sequencing was of quite low quality, so we have to trim and screen quite harshly.</p>

<p>The sequences were quite low quality and we shortened them massively. Therefore we have to assume that most sequences wonâ€™t have enough overlap to merge. Now we figure out for which amplicons this is the case.</p>

<p>So we just found out that for this dataset only one amplicon could be merged retaining over 80% of the sequence. Lets run the merge again, concatenating all amplicons with less than 80% merged by setting <code>justConcatenate</code> to <code>TRUE</code> for those.</p>

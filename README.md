[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/derele/MultiAmplicon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/derele/MultiAmplicon)

This is a pre-release version! I have used it in my own research but
the documentation is still patchy. Once fit for reseach use by people
other than myself this note will disappear/change.


## Installation
(for the adventourous)
```S
require(devtools)
devtools::insatll_github("derele/MultiAmplicon")
```

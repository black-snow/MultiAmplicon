This is a pre-release version! I have used it in my own research but
the documentation is still patchy. Once fit for reseach use by people
other than myself this note will disappear/change.


## Installation
(for the adventurous)
```S
require(devtools)
devtools::insatll_github("derele/MultiAmplicon")
```

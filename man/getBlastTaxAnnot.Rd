\arguments{
\item{MA}{A MultiAmplicon for which taxa shoudl be annotated. This
should contain a \code{sequenceTableNoChime} slot, meaning
that the MultiAmplicon pipeline needs to be followed to that
point.}

\item{dataBaseDir}{The base directory of your blast
databases. This corresponts to, and is by default obtained
from the environmental variable \code{$BLASTDB}.}

\item{db}{The blast database. Either a full path or the path
relative to the dataBaseDir.}

\item{num_threads}{The number of threads used for the blast
search.}

\item{negative_gilist}{A file containing NCBI GI numbers to
exclude from blast searches.}

\item{tempfasta}{A fasta file generated for the blast searche, a
temporary file in the respective R temporary folder by
default.}

\item{tempblast}{A blast tabular output file generated by the
blast searche, a temporary file in the respective R temporary
folder by default.}

\item{taxonSQL}{An SQL file generated by the package
\code{\link[taxonomizeR]{taxonomizeR}}}
}
\value{
An MultiAmplicon object with the taxonomy slot filled

\description{
Annotate amplified sequence variants (ASVs) with taxa labels
derived from a BLAST search.
}
\details{
Based on a BLAST search taxonomic labels are assigned to
ASVs. Currently supported taxonomy levels are c("superkingdom",
"phylum", "order", "family", "genus", "species"). For each
taxonomic level unique best taxa (based on bitscores) are
reported. If no unique best taxon exists at a particular level NA
is returned for this. The function combines evidence for taxnomic
annotations in case of seperate HSPs for (concatenated) non-merged
sequences.
